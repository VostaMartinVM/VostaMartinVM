### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Martin Vosta and I am a software engineer student who prefers front-end programming. I continuously try to expand my knowledge with both, school and personal projects. This is my repository where you can take a look on those projects. I would appreciate any feedbacks, constructive criticism, or other comments. (Dont worry, they won't hurt me :D)
